# proot runs in userspace and cannot perform real kernel mounts, so any port
# script that calls `mount` would fail. This wrapper intercepts those calls:
#
#   - squashfs sources  → extracted with unsquashfs into the destination dir
#   - everything else   → silently succeed (proc, dev, tmpfs, etc. — proot
#                         already fakes these; we just need to not abort)
#
# mount's argument order is always: [flags...] <source> <destination>
# so we grab the last two positional args regardless of what flags precede them.
